  ## getClusterHealth
  ## Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster.
  ## Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the cluster based on the health state.
  ## Similarly, use NodesHealthStateFilter and ApplicationsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of nodes and applications returned based on their aggregated health state.
  ##   timeout: int
  ##          : The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
  ##   apiVersion: string (required)
  ##             : The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.
  ## 
  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
  ##   ApplicationsHealthStateFilter: int
  ##                                : Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the result of cluster health
  ## query based on their health state.
  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from members or bitwise operations
  ## on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match the filter are returned.
  ## All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned.
  ## The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
  ## For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ## 
  ## - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
  ## - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
  ## - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
  ## - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
  ## - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
  ## - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  ##   IncludeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics: bool
  ##                                           : Indicates whether the health statistics should include the fabric:/System application health statistics. False by default.
  ## If IncludeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics is set to true, the health statistics include the entities that belong to the fabric:/System application.
  ## Otherwise, the query result includes health statistics only for user applications.
  ## The health statistics must be included in the query result for this parameter to be applied.
  ##   ExcludeHealthStatistics: bool
  ##                          : Indicates whether the health statistics should be returned as part of the query result. False by default.
  ## The statistics show the number of children entities in health state Ok, Warning, and Error.
  ##   EventsHealthStateFilter: int
  ##                          : Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.
  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
  ## Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ## 
  ## - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
  ## - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
  ## - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
  ## - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
  ## - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
  ## - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  ##   NodesHealthStateFilter: int
  ##                         : Allows filtering of the node health state objects returned in the result of cluster health query
  ## based on their health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the
  ## following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned.
  ## The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

  ## For clusters that have one or more instances of the Infrastructure Service configured,
  ## this API provides a way to send infrastructure-specific queries to a particular
  ## instance of the Infrastructure Service.
  ## 
  ## Available commands and their corresponding response formats vary depending upon
  ## the infrastructure on which the cluster is running.
  ## 
  ## This API supports the Service Fabric platform; it is not meant to be used directly from your code.
  ##   timeout: int
  ##          : The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
  ##   apiVersion: string (required)
  ##             : The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.
  ## 
  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
  ##   ServiceId: string
  ##            : The identity of the infrastructure service. This is  the full name of the infrastructure service without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. This parameter required only for the cluster that have more than one instance of infrastructure service running.
  ##   Command: string (required)
  ##          : The text of the command to be invoked. The content of the command is infrastructure-specific.

  ##   timeout: JInt
  ##          : The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
  ##   api-version: JString (required)
  ##              : The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.
  ## 
  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
  ## Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. All deployed service packages are used to evaluate the aggregated health state of the deployed application.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned.
  ## The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value can be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
  ## For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of service packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ## 
  ## - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
  ## - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
  ## - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
  ## - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
  ## - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
  ## - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  ##   ExcludeHealthStatistics: JBool
  ##                          : Indicates whether the health statistics should be returned as part of the query result. False by default.
  ## The statistics show the number of children entities in health state Ok, Warning, and Error.
  ##   EventsHealthStateFilter: JInt
  ##                          : Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.

  ##   timeout: int
  ##          : The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.
  ##   apiVersion: string (required)
  ##             : The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.
  ## 
  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
  ##   nodeName: string (required)

  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
  ## Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. All deployed service packages are used to evaluate the aggregated health state of the deployed application.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned.
  ## The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value can be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
  ## For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of service packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ## 
  ## - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
  ## - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
  ## - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
  ## - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
  ## - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
  ## - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  ##   ExcludeHealthStatistics: bool
  ##                          : Indicates whether the health statistics should be returned as part of the query result. False by default.
  ## The statistics show the number of children entities in health state Ok, Warning, and Error.
  ##   EventsHealthStateFilter: int
  ##                          : Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.

  ## Reports health state of the application deployed on a Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported.

  ## The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation.

  ## To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get deployed application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.
  ##   Immediate: bool
  ##            : A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
  ## A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
  ## If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
  ## This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
  ## Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
  ## If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
  ## This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
  ## By default, reports are not sent immediately.
  ##   timeout: int

  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

  ##   applicationId: string (required)
  ##                : The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme.
  ## Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character.
  ## For example, if the application name is "fabric:/myapp/app1", the application identity would be "myapp~app1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1" in previous versions.

  ## Gets the health of a Service Fabric node. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the node based on the health state. If the node that you specify by name does not exist in the health store, this returns an error.
  ##   timeout: int
  ##          : The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

  ##   EventsHealthStateFilter: int
  ##                          : Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.
  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
  ## Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ## 
  ## - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
  ## - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
  ## - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
  ## - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
  ## - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
  ## - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

  ## The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
  ## Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
  ## If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  ##

  ## Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This version is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
  ## 
  ## Additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
